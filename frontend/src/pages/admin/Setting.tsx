        Ready are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi.
        My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained.
        A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
        This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away - to the future, to the horizon.
        Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh. Excitement. Heh.
        A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless.
